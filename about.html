                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>We, Alondra and Iris, created this podcast to have somewhere to tell all the fantasy stories that we have. That is how this short series podcast produced by two undergraduate students with an interest in fantasy came to be.</p>
                <p>
                    We decided to make this podcast because we wanted to have a place to relax and share our story whit others. We decided to make something that people can find interesting to do in their free time. We choose this topic because we were always interested in fantasy. We wanted to introduce more people to the word of fantasy where you can let your imagination run wild and have e bit of fun. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alonda’s introduction was by hearing folktales by the elderly people and from visiting the library and reading fantasy books. She’s used to hearing a story being told and that even a change of pace can build suspense in a story. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iris’ first conscious introduction to the world of fantasy was when she started reading books about vampires. After that she quickly became more interested in fantasy and is now able to tell her own stories.
