                                    The murder takes on a new twist as the detective meets de victim's best friend, a tough werewolf who hides
                                    more than he lets on. Between his teeth and hidden emotions lies a crucial piece of the puzzle. What does the
                                    werewolf know, and why is he so determined to keep it hidden?

                                    In de dimly lit corners of the tavern, the detective faces the mysterious vampire, whose cryptic answers and
                                    hidden secrets leads the investigation down a darker path. Each word is a half-truth and each silence speaks
                                    louder than before. What secret is the vampire hiding, and will the detective be able to uncover the cryptic
                                    answers?
                                </p>

                                    The dwarf appears te be nothing more than a jester in the tavern, his laughter echoing as if he has nothing to
                                    hide. Yet, beneath all that laughter might lie secrets he's unwilling to share. As the detective digs deeper into
                                    the truth, every playful remark and every smile seem to unveil another piece of the puzzle
                                </p>

                                    The Orc hides behind a web of lies and a shaky alibi, but every evasive answer raises more questions. His
                                    unwillingness to provide clear details only fuels the detective's suspicions, leaving an unease tention in the
                                    taverne. As the detective pushes deeper, peeling back layers of half-truths and deflections, the shadows grow
                                    darker, and the mystery thickens with every passing moment.

                                    The Pixieâ€™s playful demeanor offers little more than lighthearted chatter, but her presence seems to echo the
                                    lingering mysteries of the tavern. As the detective pieces together the fragmented stories from the others,
                                    every clue points to an inevitable, shocking conclusion. The final moments are fraught with tension. Can the
                                    detective unmask the true killer before the weight of deception overwhelms him?
